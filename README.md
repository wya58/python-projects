This repository contains a collection of Python projects, focusing on data analysis**, machine learning, and data visualization. Each project highlights different techniques and real-world applications, ranging from **_data preprocessing_** and **_exploratory analysis_** to **_predictive modeling_** and **_deep learning_**.

Project Previews:

ðŸ“ˆ **Portfolio Risk Analysis**: Built predictive models for portfolio returns and decomposed risk by sectors and model-driven factors. Estimated and backtested portfolio Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall using ARIMA+GARCH and historical simulation to assess tail risk exposure.

ðŸ’¹ **Stock Return Prediction & Strategy Backtesting**: Trained machine learning modelsâ€”including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, RNN, and LSTMâ€”to forecast stock return direction. Evaluated model performance using F1 score and precision, and backtested trading strategies against a buy-and-hold benchmark.

ðŸ’³ **Loan Repayment Prediction**: Applied logistic regression to estimate loan repayment probability based on borrower demographics and loan attributes, supporting risk assessment in credit decisions.
