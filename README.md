This repository includes a collection of Python projects I've worked on, focusing on data analysis and machine learning. Each project explores different techniques, methodologies, and real-world applications, ranging from data preprocessing and visualization to predictive modeling and deep learning.

What You'll Find Here

Data Analysis ðŸ“Š: Exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering, and insights extraction.

Machine Learning ðŸ¤–: Supervised and unsupervised learning models, including regression, classification, clustering, and model evaluation.

Visualization ðŸ“ˆ: Data storytelling using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
