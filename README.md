This repository contains a collection of Python projects, focusing on data analysis**, machine learning, and data visualization. Each project highlights different techniques and real-world applications, ranging from **data preprocessing** and **exploratory analysis** to **predictive modeling** and **deep learning**.

Project Previews:

ðŸ“ˆ **Portfolio Risk Attribution**: Builds predictive models for portfolio returns and decomposes portfolio risk by sector and model-driven factors. Incorporates GARCH models to estimate volatility and backtests Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) to evaluate model performance.

ðŸ’³ **Loan Repayment Prediction**: Uses logistic regression to predict the likelihood of loan repayment, incorporating borrower characteristics and loan features.
