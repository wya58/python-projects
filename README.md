This repository contains a collection of Python projects, focusing on data analysis**, machine learning, and data visualization. Each project highlights different techniques and real-world applications, ranging from **_data preprocessing_** and **_exploratory analysis_** to **_predictive modeling_** and **_deep learning_**.

Project Previews:

ðŸ“ˆ **Portfolio Risk Attribution**: Builds predictive models for portfolio returns and decomposes portfolio risk by sector and model-driven factors.Estimated and backtested portfolio VaR and Expected Shortfall using ARIMA+GARCH and historical simulations to assess downside risk.

ðŸ’³ **Loan Repayment Prediction**: Uses logistic regression to predict the likelihood of loan repayment, incorporating borrower characteristics and loan features.
