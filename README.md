This repository contains a collection of Python projects, focusing on data analysis**, machine learning, and data visualization. Each project highlights different techniques and real-world applications, ranging from **_data preprocessing_** and **_exploratory analysis_** to **_predictive modeling_** and **_deep learning_**.

Project Previews:

ðŸ“ˆ **Portfolio Risk Analysis**: Performed multi-factor risk analysis to predict returns and identify key risk factors, utilizing techniques such as LASSO, Gradient Boosting, and PCA regression. Assessed portfolio Value at Risk (VaR) through ARIMA-GARCH models, historical simulations, and predictive models to evaluate downside risk.

ðŸ’¹ **Stock Price Modeling and Strategy Backtesting**: Developed machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, RNN, and LSTM, to forecast next-day stock returns, and backtested intraday trading strategies based on predicted prices against a benchmark strategy.

ðŸ’³ **Loan Repayment Prediction**: Applied logistic regression to estimate loan repayment probability based on borrower demographics and loan attributes, supporting risk assessment in credit decisions.
